# If you build it, who will come? Individuals’ cycling volumes and socio-demography: Evaluating urban cycling infrastructure using crowd-sourced data.

Code base of my dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the
requirements for the degree of *MSc in Urban Analytics* to the University of
Glasgow, School of Social & Political Sciences, Urban Studies.

## Abstract
> Cities are looking to the bicycle as a way to transition to a more sustainable urban transport system.
> To ensure this transition is socially just, socio-demographic differences in the effect of urban cycling policy, including infrastructure, need to be understood.
> Such evaluations currently suffer from a lack of data and appropriate methods.
> 
> This dissertation contributes a novel integrated approach to evaluate the impact of new urban cycling infrastructure on individuals' cycling levels and socio-demographic differences therein.
> The analysis is based on primary data of individual crowd-sourced cycling journey GPS tracks between 2017-2022 combined with socio-demographic variables of their creators, collected from the urban cycling app 'Bike Citizens'.
> Difference-in-(difference-in-)differences designs are applied in zero-inflated negative binomial and linear regressions.
> The analysed case is a bidirectional separated cycle path along Linke Wienzeile in Vienna, Austria, opened in November 2019.
>  
> The analysis found that individuals' monthly cycling volumes increased on average by 20 % after using the new cycle path.
> Given the design, this is an indication that the new infrastructure increased individuals' cycling levels overall.
> The analysis of socio-demographic differences in the effect did not produce clear inferences, but yielded hints for further research.
>  
> The presented kind of data and analytical method hold great potential for urban cycling research.
> Further comparative studies could form the basis of robust policy recommendations.

## Structure
The files in this repository are organised analogously to the contents of the
dissertation.

* [`Survey/`](Survey) contains everything related to the socio-demographic
  survey.
* [`Data collection/`](Data%20collection) contains the data retrieval process.
* [`Analysis/`](Analysis) contains files performing the analysis.
* [`helpers/`](helpers) contains little helper files doing hard work.

The data were strictly separated from the analysis and are not public.
